## Space X Falcon 9 Landing Analysis

In this project we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

### Context and Business Understanding

 SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.<br> 
 Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.<br>
 This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
